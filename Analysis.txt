

Observation : 
1. the data is non-null
2. There are several missing values in some categorical attributes, all coded with the "unknown" label
3. As per previuos campaign, 1373 customers have taken it (which is 3.33 % only)
4. As per our dataset, only 3 customers have default credit loan
5. As per our dataset, 21576 customers have housing loan
6. As per our dataset, 6248 customers have personal loan
7. As per our dataset, 4640 customers have taken term deposit
8. avrage duration spent on call for previous outcome, that have taken the 'term deposit' is 553 sec and those who haven't taken spends time around 220 sec..
It's obvious as the person who has to take term deposit will try to take much information on call.
9. 8.83% nonexistent cases, 14.2% cases and 65.11% cases of previous campaign have taken the term deposit
10. Those who have taken Term Deposit (target), maximum are married (2532), or may have admin job (1352) or may have university.degree (1670)
11. Maximum persons taking term deposit lies in age group :30-35
12. creating a new age_range column to specify the age pattern better
13. We have already shown the age in distribution plot that age group of around 30-36 takes "Term deposit" the most.
We have just named the age-group section and it kinda of make sense also, if we want to use it as a column in machine learning modelling
14. 

Conclusion : 
1. we have dropped every row that contained "unknown"
2. DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="entropy", max_depth=3). got the decision tree values from the tuning done below
3. with the help of current columns, our model is able to predict accuracy from 0.82 to 0.89 by tuning and 0.61 auc to 0.69 auc after tuning, for decision trees.
let's increase our columns
4. DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='gini', max_depth= 4)
with increase in number of columns, our model is able to predict 0.86 accuracy to 0.88 acc and from 0.63 to 0.71 auc for decision tree, after tuning.
So, we have some importance in it
5. with the help of current columns, our model is able to predict 0.88 accuracy and 0.67 auc for logistic regression.
let's increase our columns
6. with increase in number of columns, our model is able to predict 0.88 accuracy and 0.69 auc for logistic regression.
So, we have some importance in it
